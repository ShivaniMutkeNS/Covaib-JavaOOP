# Job Scheduling System

A comprehensive Java implementation demonstrating advanced abstraction and polymorphism through multiple job scheduling strategies.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

- **Job**: Represents a schedulable task with lifecycle management, resource requirements, and execution tracking
- **JobScheduler**: Abstract base class defining core scheduling operations and resource management
- **Concrete Schedulers**: Four different scheduling implementations showcasing polymorphism

### Scheduling Strategies

1. **Priority Scheduler**: Priority-based scheduling with job boosting capabilities
2. **Round Robin Scheduler**: Time-slice based fair scheduling with preemption
3. **Cron Scheduler**: Time-based scheduling with cron expression support
4. **Fair Share Scheduler**: Resource allocation based on user shares and quotas

## üìä Key Features

### Job Management
- Complete lifecycle tracking (pending ‚Üí running ‚Üí completed/failed/cancelled)
- Resource requirements (CPU cores, memory GB)
- Retry logic with configurable limits
- Dependency tracking and tags
- Progress monitoring

### Resource Management
- CPU and memory capacity constraints
- Resource utilization tracking
- Job admission control based on available resources
- Multi-tenancy support with user quotas

### Advanced Scheduling
- Priority queues with custom comparators
- Time slicing with preemption
- Cron expression parsing and execution
- Fair share algorithms with usage tracking

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Job Creation
```java
Job job = new Job("Database Backup", "Critical system backup", JobPriority.CRITICAL, "admin");
job.setEstimatedDuration(Duration.ofMinutes(30));
job.setCpuRequirement(2.0);
job.setMemoryRequirement(4.0);
```

### Priority Scheduling
```java
PriorityScheduler scheduler = new PriorityScheduler("Priority Scheduler", 3, 8.0, 16.0);
scheduler.submitJob(job);
scheduler.start();
```

### Cron Scheduling
```java
CronScheduler cronScheduler = new CronScheduler("Cron Scheduler", 2, 4.0, 8.0);
cronScheduler.scheduleJobWithCron(job, CronScheduler.daily());
```

### Fair Share Allocation
```java
FairShareScheduler fairScheduler = new FairShareScheduler("Fair Share", 3, 6.0, 12.0);
fairScheduler.allocateUserShare("alice", 40.0);
fairScheduler.allocateUserShare("bob", 30.0);
```

## üéØ Polymorphism Demonstration

```java
JobScheduler[] schedulers = {
    new PriorityScheduler("Priority", 3, 8.0, 16.0),
    new RoundRobinScheduler("RoundRobin", 2, 4.0, 8.0, 2000),
    new CronScheduler("Cron", 2, 4.0, 8.0),
    new FairShareScheduler("FairShare", 3, 6.0, 12.0)
};

// All schedulers implement the same interface but behave differently
for (JobScheduler scheduler : schedulers) {
    scheduler.submitJob(job);
    scheduler.start();
    System.out.println("Strategy: " + scheduler.getSchedulingStrategy());
}
```

## üìà Monitoring and Analytics

### Real-time Status
- Queue sizes and running job counts
- CPU and memory utilization percentages
- Job progress tracking and completion rates
- User fair share ratios and resource usage

### Performance Metrics
- Job completion times vs estimates
- Resource efficiency and utilization
- Scheduler throughput comparison
- Retry rates and failure analysis

## üîß Configuration Options

### Priority Scheduler
- Job priority boosting
- Priority queue reordering
- Resource-aware job selection

### Round Robin Scheduler
- Configurable time slice duration
- Preemption and job rotation
- Fair time allocation

### Cron Scheduler
- Standard cron expressions
- Next execution calculation
- Schedule management

### Fair Share Scheduler
- User share allocation (percentage-based)
- Dynamic share adjustment
- Usage tracking and enforcement

## üéÆ Demo Scenarios

The `JobSchedulingDemo` class provides comprehensive demonstrations:

1. **Priority Scheduling**: Shows how critical jobs get precedence
2. **Round Robin**: Demonstrates fair time allocation
3. **Cron Scheduling**: Time-based job execution
4. **Fair Share**: Multi-user resource allocation
5. **Scheduler Comparison**: Side-by-side performance analysis

## üèÜ Design Patterns

### Abstraction
- Abstract `JobScheduler` class defines common interface
- Concrete implementations provide specific scheduling logic
- Template method pattern for job processing workflow

### Polymorphism
- Same interface, different behaviors for each scheduler
- Runtime strategy selection based on requirements
- Uniform job submission and monitoring across all schedulers

### Encapsulation
- Job state management with controlled transitions
- Resource capacity tracking with validation
- User share allocation with quota enforcement

## üîÆ Extension Ideas

1. **Distributed Scheduling**: Multi-node job distribution
2. **Machine Learning**: Predictive job duration and resource estimation
3. **Workflow Management**: Job dependency graphs and pipeline execution
4. **Auto-scaling**: Dynamic resource allocation based on load
5. **SLA Management**: Service level agreement monitoring and enforcement
6. **Job Queuing**: Persistent job storage and recovery
7. **Notification System**: Job completion alerts and status updates

## üéØ Learning Outcomes

This implementation demonstrates:
- Advanced abstraction with multiple inheritance levels
- Polymorphism through strategy pattern implementation
- Resource management and constraint handling
- Real-world scheduling algorithm implementation
- Complex state management and lifecycle tracking
- Performance monitoring and analytics integration

Perfect for understanding how large-scale job scheduling systems like Kubernetes, Slurm, or enterprise batch processing systems work under the hood.

# ü§ñ Machine Learning Models - Learning Guide

## üéØ What You'll Learn

### Core OOP Concepts
- **Abstract Classes**: `MLModel` defines common ML operations while allowing algorithm-specific implementations
- **Template Method Pattern**: `train()`, `predict()`, `evaluate()` provide consistent ML workflows
- **Polymorphism**: Same ML operations work across different algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Neural Network)
- **Encapsulation**: Algorithm-specific parameters and internal state are hidden from clients
- **Inheritance**: All models inherit common functionality while implementing algorithm-specific features

### Enterprise Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different ML algorithms as interchangeable strategies
- **Data Processing**: Feature engineering and data preprocessing pipelines
- **Model Management**: Training, validation, and deployment workflows
- **Performance Monitoring**: Model performance tracking and drift detection
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Automated parameter optimization

## üöÄ Key Learning Objectives

1. **ML Lifecycle**: Understanding the complete ML model lifecycle from training to deployment
2. **Algorithm Selection**: Choosing appropriate algorithms for different problem types
3. **Performance Optimization**: Model tuning and performance monitoring
4. **Data Pipeline**: Understanding data preprocessing and feature engineering
5. **Production Deployment**: ML model deployment and monitoring strategies

## üîß How to Run

```bash
cd "06-machine-learning-models"

# Abstraction - Master Index

This directory contains 15 comprehensive Java projects demonstrating the concept of **Abstraction** in Object-Oriented Programming. Each project showcases how abstraction helps hide implementation details while exposing only essential features.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
- Understand abstract classes and interfaces
- Learn to design clean, maintainable code through abstraction

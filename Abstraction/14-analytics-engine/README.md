# 📊 Analytics Engine System - Learning Guide

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

### Core OOP Concepts
- **Abstract Classes**: `AnalyticsEngine` defines common analytics behavior while allowing type-specific implementations
- **Template Method Pattern**: Analytics workflow with customizable analysis types
- **Polymorphism**: Same analytics methods work across different types (Descriptive, Predictive, Real-time, Behavioral)
- **Encapsulation**: Analytics-specific algorithms and data processing are hidden from clients
- **Inheritance**: All analytics engines inherit common functionality while implementing type-specific features

### Enterprise Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different analytics types as interchangeable strategies
- **Data Processing**: Multi-source data integration and validation pipelines
- **AI Integration**: Machine learning models and predictive analytics
- **Real-time Processing**: Stream processing and instant analytics
- **Performance Monitoring**: Analytics performance tracking and optimization

## 🚀 Key Learning Objectives

1. **Data Strategy**: Understanding analytics and business intelligence systems
2. **Real-time Processing**: Stream processing and real-time analytics
3. **AI Integration**: Machine learning and predictive analytics
4. **Performance**: Large-scale data processing optimization
5. **Business Impact**: Connecting analytics to business decisions

## 🔧 How to Run

```bash
cd "14-analytics-engine"
javac *.java
java AnalyticsEngineDemo
```

- **Job Lifecycle**: Complete state management (pending → running → completed/failed)
- **Advanced Features**: Retry logic, dependency tracking, real-time monitoring
- **Polymorphism**: Same interface, different scheduling algorithms

### Abstraction Benefits

1. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new scheduling algorithms
2. **Maintainability**: Common functionality centralized in base class
3. **Testability**: Each scheduler can be tested independently
4. **Flexibility**: Runtime scheduler selection based on requirements

# 🏦 Bank Account with Alerts System - Learning Guide

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

### Core OOP Relationships
- **Composition**: `BankAccount` → `TransactionHistory` (Strong ownership - History belongs to account)
- **Aggregation**: `Bank` → `Customer` (Weak ownership - Customer can have accounts at multiple banks)
- **Association**: `Transaction` ↔ `Account` (Transaction references accounts - both exist independently)

### Enterprise Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different account types and fraud detection algorithms
- **Observer Pattern**: Transaction alerts and notifications
- **State Pattern**: Account status and transaction states
- **Command Pattern**: Transaction operations and processing

## 🚀 Key Learning Objectives

1. **Financial Systems**: Understanding banking and transaction processing
2. **Fraud Detection**: Real-time monitoring and alerting systems
3. **Compliance**: Regulatory requirements and audit trails
4. **Risk Management**: Transaction monitoring and analysis
5. **Security**: Financial data protection and security measures

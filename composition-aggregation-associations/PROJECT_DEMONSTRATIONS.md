---

## 1. Library Management System

### Problem Statement
Design a library system managing books, members, and borrowing operations with different membership tiers and fine calculations.

### Key Relationships Implemented
- **Composition**: `Library` â†’ `BookCollection` (BookCollection cannot exist without Library)
- **Aggregation**: `Library` â†’ `Member` (Members can exist independently and transfer between libraries)
- **Association**: `Member` â†” `Book` (Borrowing relationship - loose coupling)

### Expected Output
```
=== Library Management System Demo ===

1. LIBRARY SETUP
================
Created library: Central City Library
Initial book collection: 0 books
Initial members: 0

2. BOOK COLLECTION MANAGEMENT (Composition)
===========================================
Added book: The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald (ISBN: 978-0-7432-7356-5)
Added book: To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee (ISBN: 978-0-06-112008-4)
Added book: 1984 by George Orwell (ISBN: 978-0-452-28423-4)
Added book: Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen (ISBN: 978-0-14-143951-8)
Added book: The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger (ISBN: 978-0-316-76948-0)

Book collection now contains: 5 books
Collection is owned by library (Composition relationship)

3. MEMBER REGISTRATION (Aggregation)
====================================
Registered member: Alice Johnson (ID: M001) - Basic Membership
Registered member: Bob Smith (ID: M002) - Premium Membership  
Registered member: Carol Davis (ID: M003) - VIP Membership

Total members: 3
Members can exist independently of library (Aggregation relationship)

4. BORROWING OPERATIONS (Association)
====================================
Alice Johnson borrowed: The Great Gatsby
  - Borrowing limit: 3 books (Basic membership)
  - Due date: 14 days from now
  - Fine rate: $0.50 per day

Bob Smith borrowed: To Kill a Mockingbird
  - Borrowing limit: 5 books (Premium membership)
  - Due date: 21 days from now
  - Fine rate: $0.25 per day

Carol Davis borrowed: 1984
  - Borrowing limit: 10 books (VIP membership)
  - Due date: 30 days from now
  - Fine rate: $0.10 per day

5. MEMBERSHIP STRATEGY DEMONSTRATION
===================================
Testing different membership behaviors:

Basic Membership (Alice):
  - Max books: 3
  - Loan period: 14 days
  - Fine rate: $0.50/day
  - Renewal allowed: No

Premium Membership (Bob):
  - Max books: 5
  - Loan period: 21 days
  - Fine rate: $0.25/day
  - Renewal allowed: Yes (1 time)

VIP Membership (Carol):
  - Max books: 10
  - Loan period: 30 days
  - Fine rate: $0.10/day
  - Renewal allowed: Yes (unlimited)

6. OVERDUE NOTIFICATIONS (Observer Pattern)
==========================================
[NOTIFICATION] Member M001: Book 'The Great Gatsby' is overdue by 2 days. Fine: $1.00
[NOTIFICATION] Member M002: Reminder - Book 'To Kill a Mockingbird' due in 3 days
[NOTIFICATION] Member M003: VIP member - No fines applied for 'Pride and Prejudice'

7. LIBRARY ANALYTICS
====================
Library Statistics:
  Total Books: 5
  Total Members: 3
  Books Currently Borrowed: 3
  Books Available: 2
  Total Fines Collected: $1.00
  Most Popular Genre: Fiction
  Average Loan Duration: 18.5 days

=== Demo Complete ===
```

### Why This Implementation

# 📊 Analytics Pipeline System - Learning Guide

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

### Core OOP Relationships
- **Composition**: `AnalyticsPipeline` → `ProcessingStage` (Strong ownership - Stages owned by pipeline)
- **Aggregation**: `Pipeline` → `DataSource` (Weak ownership - Sources can serve multiple pipelines)
- **Association**: `Report` ↔ `Visualization` (Report uses visualizations - both exist independently)

### Enterprise Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different data processing algorithms and engines
- **Pipeline Pattern**: Data flow and processing stages
- **Observer Pattern**: Real-time updates and monitoring
- **Factory Pattern**: Processor creation and management

## 🚀 Key Learning Objectives

1. **Data Architecture**: Understanding analytics and data processing pipelines
2. **Real-time Processing**: Stream processing and real-time analytics
3. **Data Pipeline**: ETL processes and data flow management
4. **Business Intelligence**: Data-driven decision making and insights
5. **Performance**: Large-scale data processing optimization

## 🔧 How to Run

```bash
cd "11-analytics-pipeline"
javac *.java
java AnalyticsPipelineDemo
```

## üéØ Overview

This repository contains 15 comprehensive Java projects demonstrating **Composition**, **Aggregation**, and **Association** relationships through real-world enterprise-level systems. Each project showcases advanced object-oriented design principles, design patterns, and modern Java programming techniques.

### üèóÔ∏è Design Patterns & Relationships

#### **Composition** (Strong "Has-A" Relationship)
- **Definition**: A strong ownership relationship where the child cannot exist without the parent
- **Characteristics**: Lifecycle dependency, exclusive ownership
- **Example**: `Car` has `Engine` - Engine cannot exist without Car

#### **Aggregation** (Weak "Has-A" Relationship)  
- **Definition**: A weak ownership relationship where child can exist independently
- **Characteristics**: Shared ownership, independent lifecycle
- **Example**: `Department` has `Employee` - Employee can exist without Department

#### **Association** (Uses-A Relationship)
- **Definition**: A relationship where objects use each other but maintain independence
- **Characteristics**: Loose coupling, bidirectional or unidirectional
- **Example**: `Student` enrolls in `Course` - Both exist independently

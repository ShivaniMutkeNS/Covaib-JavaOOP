# 🛒 Order Payment System - Learning Guide

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

### Core OOP Relationships
- **Composition**: `Order` → `OrderItem` (Strong ownership - Items belong to specific order)
- **Aggregation**: `Order` → `Customer` (Weak ownership - Customer exists independently)
- **Association**: `Order` ↔ `PaymentMethod` (Payment processing - both exist independently)

### Enterprise Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different payment methods (Credit Card, UPI, Wallet)
- **Observer Pattern**: Order status notifications and updates
- **Command Pattern**: Order operations and payment processing
- **State Pattern**: Order lifecycle management

## 🚀 Key Learning Objectives

1. **E-commerce Architecture**: Understanding order processing and payment flows
2. **Transaction Management**: ACID properties and data consistency
3. **Payment Integration**: Multiple payment gateway strategies
4. **Customer Experience**: Order tracking and notification systems
5. **Business Logic**: Inventory management and order validation

## 🔧 How to Run

```bash
cd "03-order-payment"
javac *.java
java OrderPaymentDemo
```

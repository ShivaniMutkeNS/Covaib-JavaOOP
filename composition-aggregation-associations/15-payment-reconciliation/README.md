# 💰 Payment Reconciliation System - Learning Guide

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

### Core OOP Relationships
- **Composition**: `ReconciliationEngine` → `ReconciliationMetrics` (Strong ownership - Metrics owned by engine)
- **Aggregation**: `Engine` → `PaymentRecord` (Weak ownership - Records can exist independently)
- **Association**: `PaymentRecord` ↔ `ExternalRecord` (Matching relationship - both exist independently)

### Enterprise Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different matching algorithms and reconciliation strategies
- **Observer Pattern**: Reconciliation events and notifications
- **State Pattern**: Engine lifecycle and reconciliation states
- **Command Pattern**: Reconciliation operations and processing

## 🚀 Key Learning Objectives

1. **Financial Technology**: Understanding payment processing and reconciliation
2. **Data Matching**: Automated reconciliation algorithms and strategies
3. **Compliance**: Financial reporting and audit requirements
4. **Risk Management**: Discrepancy detection and fraud prevention
5. **Performance**: Large-scale data processing and optimization

## 🔧 How to Run

```bash
cd "15-payment-reconciliation"
javac *.java
java PaymentReconciliationDemo
```

## 🎓 Manager++ Level Insights

### Why This Matters for Leadership
- **Financial Technology**: Understanding payment processing and reconciliation
- **Data Quality**: Automated data matching and validation
- **Compliance**: Meeting regulatory requirements and audit standards
- **Risk Management**: Discrepancy detection and fraud prevention
- **Performance**: Large-scale data processing optimization

### Real-World Applications
- Payment processing systems
- Financial reconciliation platforms
- Audit and compliance systems
- Risk management platforms

# 🍽️ Restaurant Order System - Learning Guide

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

### Core OOP Relationships
- **Composition**: `Restaurant` → `Kitchen` (Strong ownership - Kitchen is part of Restaurant)
- **Aggregation**: `Restaurant` → `Staff` (Weak ownership - Staff can work elsewhere)
- **Association**: `Order` ↔ `MenuItem` (Order references menu items - both exist independently)

### Enterprise Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different cooking methods and pricing strategies
- **State Pattern**: Order status lifecycle (Pending, Cooking, Ready, Served)
- **Observer Pattern**: Kitchen notifications and order updates
- **Command Pattern**: Order operations and kitchen instructions

## 🚀 Key Learning Objectives

1. **Business Process**: Understanding restaurant operations and workflows
2. **State Management**: Order lifecycle and status tracking
3. **Kitchen Operations**: Food preparation and timing management
4. **Customer Service**: Order tracking and delivery coordination
5. **Staff Management**: Role-based operations and responsibilities

## 🔧 How to Run

```bash
cd "05-restaurant-order"
javac *.java
java RestaurantOrderDemo
```

# 🎵 Media Player System - Learning Guide

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

### Core OOP Relationships
- **Composition**: `MediaPlayer` → `AudioEngine` (Strong ownership - Engine integral to player)
- **Aggregation**: `Playlist` → `MediaFile` (Weak ownership - Files can exist in multiple playlists)
- **Association**: `MediaPlayer` ↔ `User` (User controls player - both exist independently)

### Enterprise Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different audio codecs and streaming protocols
- **State Pattern**: Playback states (Playing, Paused, Stopped)
- **Observer Pattern**: Playback events and user notifications
- **Decorator Pattern**: Audio effects and enhancements

## 🚀 Key Learning Objectives

1. **Media Technology**: Understanding audio/video processing and codec management
2. **User Experience**: Playback quality and performance optimization
3. **Streaming**: Real-time media delivery and buffering
4. **Audio Processing**: Effects, equalization, and audio enhancement
5. **Performance**: Media playback optimization and resource management

## 🔧 How to Run

```bash
cd "08-media-player"
javac *.java
java MediaPlayerDemo
```

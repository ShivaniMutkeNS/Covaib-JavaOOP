# 🛒 E-commerce Shopping Cart System - Learning Guide

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

### Core OOP Relationships
- **Composition**: `ShoppingCart` → `CartItem` (Strong ownership - Items belong to cart)

### Enterprise Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different pricing algorithms and promotion engines
- **Observer Pattern**: Inventory updates and cart synchronization
- **State Pattern**: Cart lifecycle and checkout process
- **Chain of Responsibility**: Discount application and validation

## 🚀 Key Learning Objectives

2. **Pricing Strategy**: Dynamic pricing and promotion engines
3. **Inventory Management**: Real-time stock tracking and synchronization

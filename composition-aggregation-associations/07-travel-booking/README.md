# ✈️ Travel Booking System - Learning Guide

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

### Core OOP Relationships
- **Composition**: `TravelPackage` → `BookingComponent` (Strong ownership - Package owns components)
- **Aggregation**: `Booking` → `Customer` (Weak ownership - Customer exists independently)
- **Association**: `Flight` ↔ `Airport` (Flight connects airports - both exist independently)

### Enterprise Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different pricing algorithms and booking policies
- **Composite Pattern**: Travel package assembly and management
- **Observer Pattern**: Booking notifications and updates
- **Factory Pattern**: Booking creation and management

## 🚀 Key Learning Objectives

1. **Travel Industry**: Understanding complex booking systems and travel arrangements
2. **Package Management**: Multi-component travel package assembly
3. **Pricing Strategy**: Dynamic pricing and package optimization
4. **Customer Experience**: End-to-end travel planning and booking
5. **Business Logic**: Travel policies, restrictions, and validations

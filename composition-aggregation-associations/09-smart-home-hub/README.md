# 🏠 Smart Home Hub System - Learning Guide

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

### Core OOP Relationships
- **Composition**: `SmartHome` → `Room` (Strong ownership - Rooms are part of home)
- **Aggregation**: `Room` → `SmartDevice` (Weak ownership - Devices can be moved)
- **Association**: `AutomationRule` ↔ `SmartDevice` (Rules control devices - both exist independently)

### Enterprise Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different device types and automation algorithms
- **Observer Pattern**: Device state changes and event handling
- **Command Pattern**: Device operations and automation execution
- **State Pattern**: Home modes (Home, Away, Sleep)

## 🚀 Key Learning Objectives

1. **IoT Architecture**: Understanding smart home system design and device management
2. **Automation**: Rule-based system control and intelligent automation
3. **Device Management**: Managing diverse IoT devices and protocols
4. **Energy Management**: Smart home optimization and efficiency
5. **User Experience**: Seamless home automation and control

## 🔧 How to Run

```bash
cd "09-smart-home-hub"
javac *.java
java SmartHomeHubDemo
```

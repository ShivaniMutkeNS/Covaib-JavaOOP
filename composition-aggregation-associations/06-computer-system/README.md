# 💻 Computer System - Learning Guide

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

### Core OOP Relationships
- **Composition**: `Computer` → `CPU`, `RAM`, `Storage` (Strong ownership - Hardware components)
- **Aggregation**: `Computer` → `PeripheralDevice` (Weak ownership - External devices)
- **Association**: `Computer` ↔ `User` (Usage relationship - both exist independently)

### Enterprise Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different component types and performance algorithms
- **Observer Pattern**: System monitoring and performance tracking
- **Builder Pattern**: Computer assembly and configuration
- **Decorator Pattern**: Component upgrades and enhancements

## 🚀 Key Learning Objectives

1. **Hardware Architecture**: Understanding computer system design and components
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time system health tracking and optimization
3. **Component Management**: Hardware upgrade and maintenance strategies
4. **System Optimization**: Performance tuning and resource allocation
5. **User Experience**: System responsiveness and reliability

## 🔧 How to Run

```bash
cd "06-computer-system"
javac *.java
java ComputerSystemDemo
```

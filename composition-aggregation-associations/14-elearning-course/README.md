# 📚 E-learning Course Management System - Learning Guide

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

### Core OOP Relationships
- **Composition**: `Course` → `Module` (Strong ownership - Modules belong to course)
- **Aggregation**: `Course` → `Student` (Weak ownership - Students can enroll in multiple courses)
- **Association**: `Student` ↔ `Assessment` (Student takes assessments - both exist independently)

### Enterprise Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different assessment types and content delivery methods
- **Observer Pattern**: Progress tracking and notifications
- **State Pattern**: Course lifecycle and student progress
- **Template Method**: Content rendering and assessment delivery

## 🚀 Key Learning Objectives

1. **Education Technology**: Understanding e-learning platforms and course management
2. **Content Management**: Course structure and content delivery
3. **Student Progress**: Tracking and analytics systems
4. **Assessment Systems**: Different types of assessments and grading
5. **Personalization**: Adaptive learning and content recommendations

## 🔧 How to Run

```bash
cd "14-elearning-course"
javac *.java
java ELearningCourseDemo
```

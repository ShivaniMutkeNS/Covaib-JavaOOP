# 🎮 Gaming Character System - Learning Guide

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

### Core OOP Relationships
- **Composition**: `GameCharacter` → `Inventory` (Strong ownership - Inventory belongs to character)
- **Aggregation**: `Character` → `Equipment` (Weak ownership - Equipment can be traded)
- **Association**: `Character` ↔ `Skill` (Character learns skills - both exist independently)

### Enterprise Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different combat, movement, and leveling strategies
- **Observer Pattern**: Character events and notifications
- **State Pattern**: Character states and status effects
- **Command Pattern**: Skill execution and combat actions

## 🚀 Key Learning Objectives

1. **Game Development**: Understanding game system architecture and character progression
2. **RPG Mechanics**: Character stats, equipment, and skill systems
3. **Combat Systems**: Strategy patterns and battle mechanics
4. **Character Progression**: Leveling, skill trees, and advancement
5. **Equipment Management**: Item systems and trading mechanics

## 🔧 How to Run

```bash
cd "13-gaming-character"

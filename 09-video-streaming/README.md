# Video Streaming Platform - Abstraction Project

## 🎬 Project Overview

This project demonstrates advanced abstraction concepts in Java through a comprehensive video streaming platform system. It showcases how different streaming platforms (YouTube, Netflix, Twitch) can share common functionality while maintaining their unique characteristics.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

1. **VideoQuality.java** - Enumeration defining video quality levels (240p to 8K)
2. **VideoCodec.java** - Enumeration for different video compression formats
3. **StreamingMetrics.java** - Analytics and performance tracking system
4. **VideoStream.java** - Abstract base class defining core streaming functionality
5. **YouTubeStream.java** - YouTube-specific implementation with user-generated content features
6. **NetflixStream.java** - Netflix implementation with premium content and offline downloads
7. **TwitchStream.java** - Twitch implementation with live streaming and real-time chat
8. **VideoStreamingDemo.java** - Comprehensive demonstration of all features

## 🎯 Key Abstraction Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Abstract Classes
- `VideoStream` defines common streaming behavior
- Forces concrete classes to implement platform-specific methods
- Provides shared functionality like play, pause, seek operations

### 2. Polymorphism
- Same interface methods behave differently across platforms
- Runtime method resolution based on actual object type
- Unified handling of different streaming platforms

### 3. Encapsulation
- Platform-specific data hidden within concrete classes
- Controlled access through getter methods
- Internal state management for streaming metrics

### 4. Inheritance
- All streaming platforms inherit from `VideoStream`
- Specialized behavior while maintaining common interface
- Code reuse through inherited methods

## 📊 Quality & Codec Management

### Supported Quality Levels
- 240p (Low) - 0.4 Mbps
- 480p (Medium) - 1.0 Mbps
- 720p (High) - 2.5 Mbps
- 1080p (Full HD) - 5.0 Mbps
- 4K (Ultra HD) - 15.0 Mbps
- 8K (Ultra HD) - 50.0 Mbps

### Supported Codecs
- H.264/AVC - Standard compression, hardware accelerated
- H.265/HEVC - High compression, hardware accelerated
- VP9 - Google's codec, good compression
- AV1 - Next-gen codec, excellent compression
- MPEG-2 - Legacy codec for compatibility

## 🔧 How to Compile and Run

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Command line access

### Compilation
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd "c:\Users\Shivani Mutke\Documents\Covaib-JavaOOP\abstraction\09-video-streaming"

# Compile all Java files
javac *.java

# Run the demonstration
java VideoStreamingDemo
```

### Alternative IDEs
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Open the folder and run VideoStreamingDemo.java
- **Eclipse**: Import as Java project and run main method
- **VS Code**: Use Java Extension Pack and run the main class

## 📈 Expected Output

The demonstration will show:

1. **Basic Playback** - Polymorphic behavior across platforms
2. **Platform Features** - Unique capabilities of each service
3. **Adaptive Streaming** - Quality adjustment based on conditions
4. **Analytics** - Comprehensive streaming metrics
5. **Codec Comparison** - File size differences between formats

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

After studying this project, you should understand:

- How abstraction simplifies complex systems
- The power of polymorphism in object-oriented design
- Real-world application of inheritance hierarchies
- Encapsulation for data protection and organization
- Enum usage for type-safe constants
- Metrics collection and performance monitoring
- Thread-based simulation of real-time processes

## 🔍 Code Analysis Points

### Abstract Methods vs Concrete Methods
- `initializeStream()`, `loadVideo()`, `bufferContent()` - Must be implemented
- `play()`, `pause()`, `stop()` - Shared implementation with customization points

### Platform Differentiation
- **YouTube**: Focus on user content and social features
- **Netflix**: Premium content with advanced streaming tech
- **Twitch**: Live interaction and gaming community features

### Design Patterns Used
- **Template Method**: VideoStream defines algorithm structure
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different quality adjustment strategies
- **Observer Pattern**: Metrics tracking system
- **Factory Pattern**: Could be extended for stream creation

## 🚀 Extension Ideas

1. Add more streaming platforms (Amazon Prime, Disney+, Hulu)
2. Implement user authentication and profiles
3. Add recommendation algorithms
4. Create a GUI interface
5. Add network simulation with realistic conditions
6. Implement actual video file handling
7. Add closed captioning and accessibility features
8. Create playlist and queue management systems

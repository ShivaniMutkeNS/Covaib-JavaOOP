# ü¶Å Zoo Animals - Inheritance & Method Overriding

## Problem Statement
Create a zoo management system with different types of animals. Implement inheritance with abstract base class `Animal` and concrete subclasses `Lion`, `Elephant`, and `Penguin`. Each animal should override the abstract methods `makeSound()` and `move()` with their specific behaviors.

## Learning Objectives
- **Abstract Classes**: Understanding abstract methods and classes
- **Method Overriding**: Implementing polymorphic behavior
- **Inheritance Basics**: Creating is-a relationships
- **Runtime Polymorphism**: Using parent references to call child methods

## Class Hierarchy

```
Animal (Abstract)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Lion
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Elephant
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Penguin
```

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Abstract Base Class (`Animal`)
- Contains abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses
- Provides common functionality (eat, sleep, getters)
- Cannot be instantiated directly

### 2. Method Overriding
- Each subclass provides its own implementation of `makeSound()` and `move()`
- Demonstrates polymorphic behavior at runtime

### 3. Constructor Chaining
- Subclasses call parent constructor using `super()`
- Ensures proper initialization of inherited fields

## Code Structure

### Animal.java (Abstract Base Class)
```java
public abstract class Animal {
    protected String name;
    protected int age;
    protected String species;
    protected boolean isHealthy;
    
    // Abstract methods - must be implemented by subclasses
    public abstract String makeSound();
    public abstract String move();
    
    // Concrete methods - shared by all animals
    public String eat() { ... }
    public String sleep() { ... }
}
```

### Lion.java (Concrete Subclass)
```java
public class Lion extends Animal {
    private String maneColor;
    private boolean isAlpha;
    
    @Override
    public String makeSound() {
        return isAlpha ? "ROAR! ROAR! ROAR!" : "Roar!";
    }
    
    @Override
    public String move() {
        return "prowls gracefully across the savanna";
    }
    
    // Lion-specific methods
    public String hunt() { ... }
    public String leadPride() { ... }
}
```

### Elephant.java (Concrete Subclass)
```java
public class Elephant extends Animal {
    private double trunkLength;
    private int tuskCount;
    private String herdRole;
    
    @Override
    public String makeSound() {
        return age < 5 ? "trumpets softly" : "trumpets loudly";
    }
    
    @Override
    public String move() {
        return "walks majestically with heavy footsteps";
    }
    
    // Elephant-specific methods
    public String useTrunk() { ... }
    public String remember() { ... }
}
```

### Penguin.java (Concrete Subclass)
```java
public class Penguin extends Animal {
    private String habitat;
    private boolean canSwim;
    private String mateStatus;
    
    @Override
    public String makeSound() {
        return age < 2 ? "chirps" : "honks";
    }
    
    @Override
    public String move() {
        return canSwim ? "waddles and swims" : "waddles clumsily";
    }
    
    // Penguin-specific methods
    public String swim() { ... }
    public String slide() { ... }
}
```

## How to Run

1. Compile all Java files:
```bash
javac *.java
```

2. Run the demo:
```bash
java ZooDemo
```

## Expected Output

## Key Learning Points

1. **Abstract Methods**: Force subclasses to implement specific behaviors
2. **Method Overriding**: Each subclass provides its own implementation
3. **Polymorphism**: Same method call produces different results based on object type
4. **Inheritance**: Code reuse and shared functionality
5. **Encapsulation**: Private fields with public getters
6. **Constructor Chaining**: Proper initialization using `super()`

## Advanced Concepts Demonstrated

- **Runtime Polymorphism**: Method calls resolved at runtime based on actual object type
- **Abstract Class Design**: Cannot instantiate abstract classes directly
- **Method Overriding vs Overloading**: Different concepts with different purposes
- **Access Modifiers**: Protected fields accessible to subclasses
- **String Formatting**: Professional output formatting

This example demonstrates the fundamental concepts of inheritance and polymorphism in Java, providing a solid foundation for understanding more complex object-oriented programming patterns.

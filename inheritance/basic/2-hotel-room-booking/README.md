# üè® Hotel Room Booking System - Inheritance & Method Overriding

## Problem Statement
Create a hotel room booking system with different types of rooms. Implement inheritance with base class `Room` and subclasses `StandardRoom`, `DeluxeRoom`, and `SuiteRoom`. Each room type should override the abstract methods `getPrice()` and `getAmenities()` with their specific pricing logic and amenities.

## Learning Objectives
- **Constructor Chaining**: Using `super()` to call parent constructor
- **Method Overriding**: Implementing polymorphic behavior for pricing and amenities
- **Shared vs Specialized Fields**: Common fields in base class, specific fields in subclasses
- **Abstract Methods**: Forcing subclasses to implement specific behaviors

## Class Hierarchy

```
Room (Abstract)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ StandardRoom
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DeluxeRoom
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SuiteRoom
```

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Constructor Chaining
- Subclasses call parent constructor using `super()`
- Ensures proper initialization of inherited fields
- Allows additional initialization of subclass-specific fields

### 2. Method Overriding
- Each subclass provides its own implementation of `getPrice()` and `getAmenities()`
- Demonstrates polymorphic behavior at runtime
- Different pricing logic for each room type

### 3. Shared vs Specialized Fields
- Common fields (roomNumber, floor, basePrice) in base class
- Specific fields (hasBalcony, hasJacuzzi, butlerService) in subclasses
- Demonstrates code reuse and specialization

## Code Structure

### Room.java (Abstract Base Class)
```java
public abstract class Room {
    protected int roomNumber;
    protected int floor;
    protected double basePrice;
    protected int maxOccupancy;
    protected boolean isAvailable;
    protected String roomType;
    
    // Abstract methods - must be implemented by subclasses
    public abstract double getPrice();
    public abstract String getAmenities();
    
    // Concrete methods - shared by all rooms
    public boolean bookRoom() { ... }
    public boolean checkOut() { ... }
}
```

### StandardRoom.java (Concrete Subclass)
```java
public class StandardRoom extends Room {
    private boolean hasBalcony;
    private String viewType;
    private boolean hasMiniBar;
    
    public StandardRoom(...) {
        super(roomNumber, floor, basePrice, maxOccupancy, "Standard");
        // Initialize subclass-specific fields
    }
    
    @Override
    public double getPrice() {
        double totalPrice = basePrice;
        // Add surcharges based on features
        if (hasBalcony) totalPrice += 20.0;
        // ... more pricing logic
        return totalPrice;
    }
    
    @Override
    public String getAmenities() {
        // Return standard room specific amenities
    }
}
```

### DeluxeRoom.java (Concrete Subclass)
```java
public class DeluxeRoom extends Room {
    private boolean hasJacuzzi;
    private boolean hasKitchenette;
    private String bedType;
    private boolean hasRoomService;
    
    @Override
    public double getPrice() {
        double totalPrice = basePrice;
        // Add deluxe-specific surcharges
        if (hasJacuzzi) totalPrice += 50.0;
        // ... more pricing logic
        totalPrice *= 1.15; // 15% luxury surcharge
        return totalPrice;
    }
}
```

### SuiteRoom.java (Concrete Subclass)
```java
public class SuiteRoom extends Room {
    private boolean hasLivingRoom;
    private boolean hasDiningArea;
    private boolean hasPrivateBar;
    private String butlerService;
    private boolean hasPrivateElevator;
    
    @Override
    public double getPrice() {
        double totalPrice = basePrice;
        // Add suite-specific surcharges
        if (hasLivingRoom) totalPrice += 100.0;
        // ... more pricing logic
        totalPrice *= 1.25; // 25% luxury surcharge
        return totalPrice;
    }
}
```

## How to Run

1. Compile all Java files:
```bash
javac *.java
```

2. Run the demo:
```bash
java HotelDemo
```

## Expected Output

## Key Learning Points

1. **Constructor Chaining**: Using `super()` to properly initialize inherited fields
2. **Method Overriding**: Each subclass provides its own implementation of abstract methods
3. **Shared vs Specialized Fields**: Common fields in base class, specific fields in subclasses
4. **Polymorphism**: Same method call produces different results based on object type
5. **Abstract Methods**: Force subclasses to implement specific behaviors
6. **Encapsulation**: Private fields with public getters

## Advanced Concepts Demonstrated

- **Runtime Polymorphism**: Method calls resolved at runtime based on actual object type
- **Abstract Class Design**: Cannot instantiate abstract classes directly
- **Method Overriding vs Overloading**: Different concepts with different purposes
- **Access Modifiers**: Protected fields accessible to subclasses
- **String Formatting**: Professional output formatting
- **Business Logic**: Real-world pricing and amenity calculations

## Design Patterns Used

1. **Template Method Pattern**: Abstract base class defines the structure, subclasses implement specific details
2. **Strategy Pattern**: Different pricing strategies for different room types
3. **Polymorphism**: Single interface for different room types

This example demonstrates the fundamental concepts of inheritance and method overriding in Java, providing a solid foundation for understanding more complex object-oriented programming patterns in real-world applications.

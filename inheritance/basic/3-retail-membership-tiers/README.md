# üõçÔ∏è Retail Membership Tiers - Inheritance & Polymorphic Methods

## Problem Statement
Create a retail membership system with different tiers. Implement inheritance with base class `Membership` and subclasses `SilverMember`, `GoldMember`, and `PlatinumMember`. Each membership tier should override the abstract methods `calculateDiscount()`, `calculatePoints()`, and `getBenefits()` with their specific business logic.

## Learning Objectives
- **Base Class + Polymorphic Methods**: Common functionality with specialized behavior
- **Method Overriding**: Each subclass provides its own implementation
- **Abstract Methods**: Force subclasses to implement specific behaviors
- **Business Logic**: Real-world pricing and benefit calculations

## Class Hierarchy

```
Membership (Abstract)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SilverMember
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GoldMember
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PlatinumMember
```

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Base Class + Polymorphic Methods
- Common functionality (makePurchase, redeemPoints) in base class
- Specialized behavior (discount calculation, point earning) in subclasses
- Runtime polymorphism for different membership tiers

### 2. Method Overriding
- Each subclass provides its own implementation of abstract methods
- Demonstrates polymorphic behavior at runtime
- Different business logic for each membership tier

### 3. Abstract Methods
- Force subclasses to implement specific behaviors
- Ensure consistent interface across all membership types
- Enable polymorphic method calls

## Code Structure

### Membership.java (Abstract Base Class)
```java
public abstract class Membership {
    protected String memberId;
    protected String memberName;
    protected String email;
    protected String joinDate;
    protected double totalSpent;
    protected int pointsEarned;
    protected boolean isActive;
    protected String tierName;
    
    // Abstract methods - must be implemented by subclasses
    public abstract double calculateDiscount();
    public abstract int calculatePoints(double amount);
    public abstract String getBenefits();
    public abstract double getUpgradeThreshold();
    
    // Concrete methods - shared by all memberships
    public double makePurchase(double amount) { ... }
    public double redeemPoints(int pointsToRedeem) { ... }
}
```

### SilverMember.java (Concrete Subclass)
```java
public class SilverMember extends Membership {
    private static final double SILVER_DISCOUNT = 0.05; // 5% discount
    private static final int POINTS_PER_DOLLAR = 1; // 1 point per dollar
    private static final double UPGRADE_THRESHOLD = 1000.0; // $1000 for upgrade
    
    @Override
    public double calculateDiscount() {
        return SILVER_DISCOUNT;
    }
    
    @Override
    public int calculatePoints(double amount) {
        return (int) (amount * POINTS_PER_DOLLAR);
    }
    
    @Override
    public String getBenefits() {
        return "Silver Member Benefits: 5% discount, 1 point per dollar, ...";
    }
}
```

### GoldMember.java (Concrete Subclass)
```java
public class GoldMember extends Membership {
    private static final double GOLD_DISCOUNT = 0.10; // 10% discount
    private static final int POINTS_PER_DOLLAR = 2; // 2 points per dollar
    private static final double UPGRADE_THRESHOLD = 2500.0; // $2500 for upgrade
    
    @Override
    public double calculateDiscount() {
        return GOLD_DISCOUNT;
    }
    
    @Override
    public int calculatePoints(double amount) {
        return (int) (amount * POINTS_PER_DOLLAR);
    }
    
    @Override
    public String getBenefits() {
        return "Gold Member Benefits: 10% discount, 2 points per dollar, ...";
    }
}
```

### PlatinumMember.java (Concrete Subclass)
```java
public class PlatinumMember extends Membership {
    private static final double PLATINUM_DISCOUNT = 0.15; // 15% discount
    private static final int POINTS_PER_DOLLAR = 3; // 3 points per dollar
    private static final double UPGRADE_THRESHOLD = 5000.0; // $5000 for upgrade
    
    @Override
    public double calculateDiscount() {
        return PLATINUM_DISCOUNT;
    }
    
    @Override
    public int calculatePoints(double amount) {
        return (int) (amount * POINTS_PER_DOLLAR);
    }
    
    @Override
    public String getBenefits() {
        return "Platinum Member Benefits: 15% discount, 3 points per dollar, ...";
    }
}
```

## Key Learning Points

1. **Base Class + Polymorphic Methods**: Common functionality with specialized behavior
2. **Method Overriding**: Each subclass provides its own implementation
3. **Abstract Methods**: Force subclasses to implement specific behaviors
4. **Business Logic**: Real-world pricing and benefit calculations
5. **Polymorphism**: Same method call produces different results based on object type
6. **Encapsulation**: Private fields with public getters

## Advanced Concepts Demonstrated

- **Runtime Polymorphism**: Method calls resolved at runtime based on actual object type
- **Abstract Class Design**: Cannot instantiate abstract classes directly
- **Method Overriding vs Overloading**: Different concepts with different purposes
- **Access Modifiers**: Protected fields accessible to subclasses
- **String Formatting**: Professional output formatting
- **Business Logic**: Real-world pricing and benefit calculations
- **Constants**: Using static final for configuration values

## Design Patterns Used

1. **Template Method Pattern**: Abstract base class defines the structure, subclasses implement specific details
2. **Strategy Pattern**: Different pricing strategies for different membership tiers
3. **Polymorphism**: Single interface for different membership types

This example demonstrates the fundamental concepts of inheritance and polymorphism in Java, providing a solid foundation for understanding more complex object-oriented programming patterns in real-world applications.

---

## 🟢 BEGINNER LEVEL - FOUNDATION CONCEPTS

### 1. 🦁 Zoo Animals
**Learning Focus:** Abstract Methods & Method Overriding Basics

**What We Learned:**
- **Abstract Classes:** Created `Animal` as an abstract base class that cannot be instantiated
- **Abstract Methods:** Defined `makeSound()` and `move()` as abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses
- **Method Overriding:** Each animal (Lion, Elephant, Penguin) provides its own implementation of abstract methods
- **Polymorphism:** Same method call (`animal.makeSound()`) produces different results based on actual object type
- **Inheritance Basics:** Understanding "is-a" relationships (Lion IS-A Animal)

**Key Concepts:**
```java
// Abstract base class
public abstract class Animal {
    public abstract void makeSound(); // Must be implemented by subclasses
    public abstract void move();      // Must be implemented by subclasses
}

// Concrete subclass
public class Lion extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void makeSound() { System.out.println("Roars!"); }
    @Override
    public void move() { System.out.println("Prowls"); }
}
```

### 2. 🏨 Hotel Room Booking
**Learning Focus:** Constructor Chaining & Shared vs Specialized Fields

**What We Learned:**
- **Constructor Chaining:** Using `super()` to call parent class constructor
- **Shared Fields:** Common properties like `roomNumber`, `price` in base class
- **Specialized Fields:** Unique properties like `amenities` in subclasses
- **Method Overriding:** Different pricing logic for different room types
- **Encapsulation:** Private fields with public getters/setters

**Key Concepts:**
```java
// Constructor chaining
public class DeluxeRoom extends Room {
    public DeluxeRoom(String roomNumber, double basePrice) {
        super(roomNumber, basePrice); // Call parent constructor
        this.amenities = "WiFi, TV, AC, Mini Bar, Balcony";
    }
    
    @Override
    public double getPrice() {
        return basePrice + 50.0; // Specialized pricing logic
    }
}
```

### 3. 🛍️ Retail Membership Tiers
**Learning Focus:** Base Class + Polymorphic Methods

**What We Learned:**
- **Polymorphic Methods:** Same method call produces different behavior based on membership type
- **Business Logic:** Different discount calculations for different membership levels
- **Inheritance Hierarchy:** Clear "is-a" relationship (SilverMember IS-A Membership)
- **Code Reuse:** Common functionality in base class, specialized behavior in subclasses

**Key Concepts:**
```java
// Polymorphic method call
Membership[] members = {new SilverMember(), new GoldMember(), new PlatinumMember()};
for (Membership member : members) {
    double discount = member.calculateDiscount(); // Different behavior for each type
}
```

            balance -= amount;
            return true;
        }

    @Override
    public boolean withdraw(double amount) {
        if (balance - amount >= -overdraftLimit) {
            balance -= amount;

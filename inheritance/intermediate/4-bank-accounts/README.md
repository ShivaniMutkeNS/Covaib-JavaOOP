# üè¶ Bank Accounts System - Inheritance & Method Overriding

## Problem Statement
Create a bank account management system with different types of accounts. Implement inheritance with base class `Account` and subclasses `SavingsAccount`, `CurrentAccount`, and `FixedDepositAccount`. Each account type should override the abstract methods `withdraw()` and `calculateInterest()` with their specific business rules and constraints.

## Learning Objectives
- **Overriding with Rules**: Each account type has different withdrawal and interest rules
- **Encapsulated Balance Handling**: Secure balance management with business logic
- **Abstract Methods**: Force subclasses to implement specific behaviors
- **Real-world Business Logic**: Banking regulations and constraints

## Class Hierarchy

```
Account (Abstract)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SavingsAccount
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CurrentAccount
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ FixedDepositAccount
```

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Overriding with Rules
- Each account type has different withdrawal rules and constraints
- Savings: Daily/monthly limits, minimum balance
- Current: Overdraft facility, unlimited transactions
- Fixed Deposit: Maturity requirements, early withdrawal penalties

### 2. Encapsulated Balance Handling
- Balance is protected and can only be modified through controlled methods
- Business rules are enforced at the method level
- Different validation rules for different account types

### 3. Abstract Methods
- Force subclasses to implement specific behaviors
- Ensure consistent interface across all account types
- Enable polymorphic method calls

## Code Structure

### Account.java (Abstract Base Class)
```java
public abstract class Account {
    protected String accountNumber;
    protected String accountHolderName;
    protected double balance;
    protected String accountType;
    protected boolean isActive;
    protected double minimumBalance;
    
    // Abstract methods - must be implemented by subclasses
    public abstract boolean withdraw(double amount);
    public abstract double calculateInterest();
    public abstract String getAccountFeatures();
    
    // Concrete methods - shared by all accounts
    public boolean deposit(double amount) { ... }
    public double getBalance() { ... }
}
```

### SavingsAccount.java (Concrete Subclass)
```java
public class SavingsAccount extends Account {
    private static final double INTEREST_RATE = 0.02; // 2% annual interest
    private static final double WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT = 1000.0; // Daily withdrawal limit
    private static final int MAX_WITHDRAWALS = 6; // Maximum withdrawals per month
    private int monthlyWithdrawals;
    private double dailyWithdrawn;
    
    @Override
    public boolean withdraw(double amount) {
        // Check daily limit, monthly limit, minimum balance
        if (amount > WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT) return false;
        if (monthlyWithdrawals >= MAX_WITHDRAWALS) return false;
        if (balance - amount < minimumBalance) return false;
        // ... withdrawal logic
    }
    
    @Override
    public double calculateInterest() {
        return balance * INTEREST_RATE;
    }
}
```

### CurrentAccount.java (Concrete Subclass)
```java
public class CurrentAccount extends Account {
    private static final double INTEREST_RATE = 0.01; // 1% annual interest
    private static final double OVERDRAFT_LIMIT = 5000.0; // Overdraft limit
    private static final double MONTHLY_FEE = 10.0; // Monthly maintenance fee
    private double overdraftUsed;
    private boolean hasOverdraft;
    
    @Override
    public boolean withdraw(double amount) {
        // Check available balance + overdraft
        double availableBalance = balance + (hasOverdraft ? (OVERDRAFT_LIMIT - overdraftUsed) : 0);
        if (amount > availableBalance) return false;
        // ... withdrawal logic with overdraft handling
    }
    
    @Override
    public double calculateInterest() {
        return Math.max(0, balance) * INTEREST_RATE; // Only on positive balance
    }
}
```

### FixedDepositAccount.java (Concrete Subclass)
```java
public class FixedDepositAccount extends Account {
    private static final double INTEREST_RATE = 0.05; // 5% annual interest
    private int termMonths;
    private String maturityDate;
    private boolean isMatured;
    private double penaltyRate;
    
    @Override
    public boolean withdraw(double amount) {
        if (isMatured) {
            // Allow withdrawal without penalty
        } else if (earlyWithdrawalAllowed) {
            // Apply penalty for early withdrawal
        } else {
            // Deny withdrawal until maturity
        }
    }
    
    @Override
    public double calculateInterest() {
        double termMultiplier = (double) termMonths / 12.0;
        return balance * INTEREST_RATE * termMultiplier;
    }
}
```

## How to Run

1. Compile all Java files:
```bash
javac *.java
```

2. Run the demo:
```bash
java BankDemo
```

## Key Learning Points

1. **Overriding with Rules**: Each account type has different business rules and constraints
2. **Encapsulated Balance Handling**: Secure balance management with business logic
3. **Abstract Methods**: Force subclasses to implement specific behaviors
4. **Real-world Business Logic**: Banking regulations and constraints
5. **Polymorphism**: Same method call produces different results based on object type
6. **Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and error handling

## Advanced Concepts Demonstrated

- **Runtime Polymorphism**: Method calls resolved at runtime based on actual object type
- **Abstract Class Design**: Cannot instantiate abstract classes directly
- **Method Overriding vs Overloading**: Different concepts with different purposes
- **Access Modifiers**: Protected fields accessible to subclasses
- **String Formatting**: Professional output formatting
- **Business Logic**: Real-world banking regulations and constraints
- **State Management**: Account state tracking and validation

## Design Patterns Used

1. **Template Method Pattern**: Abstract base class defines the structure, subclasses implement specific details
2. **Strategy Pattern**: Different withdrawal and interest strategies for different account types
3. **Polymorphism**: Single interface for different account types

This example demonstrates the fundamental concepts of inheritance and method overriding in Java, providing a solid foundation for understanding more complex object-oriented programming patterns in real-world applications.

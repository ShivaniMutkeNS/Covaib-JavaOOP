# ðŸ’³ Payment Gateway System - Abstract Base + Real Polymorphism

## Problem Statement
Create a payment gateway system with different payment methods. Implement inheritance with base class `Payment` and subclasses `CreditCardPayment`, `UPIPayment`, `PayPalPayment`, and `CryptoPayment`. Each payment method should override the abstract methods `processPayment()`, `calculateProcessingFee()`, `getPaymentFeatures()`, and `validatePayment()` with their specific business logic and retry policies.

## Learning Objectives
- **Abstract Base + Real Polymorphism**: Different payment methods with different processing logic
- **Method Overriding**: Each payment method has different fee structures and validation rules
- **Real-world Business Logic**: Payment processing, fraud detection, retry policies
- **Complex Inheritance**: Multiple payment types with shared and specialized behavior

## Class Hierarchy

```
Payment (Abstract)
â”œâ”€â”€ CreditCardPayment
â”œâ”€â”€ UPIPayment
â”œâ”€â”€ PayPalPayment
â””â”€â”€ CryptoPayment
```

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Abstract Base + Real Polymorphism
- **Payment**: Abstract base class with common payment functionality
- **CreditCardPayment**: Card processing with fraud detection and 3D Secure
- **UPIPayment**: UPI-based payments with bank integration
- **PayPalPayment**: PayPal integration with international support
- **CryptoPayment**: Cryptocurrency payments with blockchain integration

### 2. Method Overriding
- Each payment method provides its own implementation of abstract methods
- Different processing logic for each payment type
- Different fee structures and validation rules

### 3. Real-world Business Logic
- Payment processing with retry policies
- Fraud detection and risk assessment
- Fee calculation based on payment method
- Transaction tracking and status management

## Key Learning Points

1. **Abstract Base + Real Polymorphism**: Different payment methods with different processing logic
2. **Method Overriding**: Each payment method provides its own implementation
3. **Real-world Business Logic**: Payment processing, fraud detection, retry policies
4. **Complex Inheritance**: Multiple payment types with shared and specialized behavior
5. **Polymorphism**: Same method call produces different results based on payment type
6. **Business Rules**: Different fee structures and validation rules for each payment method

## Advanced Concepts Demonstrated

- **Runtime Polymorphism**: Method calls resolved at runtime based on actual object type
- **Abstract Class Design**: Cannot instantiate abstract classes directly
- **Method Overriding vs Overloading**: Different concepts with different purposes
- **Access Modifiers**: Protected fields accessible to subclasses
- **String Formatting**: Professional output formatting
- **Real-world Business Logic**: Payment processing, fraud detection, retry policies
- **Complex Inheritance**: Multiple payment types with shared and specialized behavior

## Design Patterns Used

1. **Template Method Pattern**: Abstract base class defines the structure, subclasses implement specific details
2. **Strategy Pattern**: Different payment processing strategies for different payment types
3. **Polymorphism**: Single interface for different payment types

This example demonstrates the fundamental concepts of inheritance and method overriding in Java, providing a solid foundation for understanding more complex object-oriented programming patterns in real-world applications.

# Immutable App Config Loader

## Introduction
In modern software development, managing application configurations is crucial for ensuring that applications behave consistently across different environments. An Immutable App Config Loader helps in achieving this by providing a structure where configurations cannot be altered once set.

## MAANG-level Scenario
Imagine a scenario where a large-scale application is being developed by a team that collaborates across multiple MAANG companies. Each company has its own set of configurations for various environments (development, testing, production). An Immutable App Config Loader serves as a centralized solution that loads configuration settings that remain unchanged throughout the application's lifecycle. 

This approach reduces the risk of configuration drift and ensures that all teams are working with the same app settings, which is vital for maintaining the integrity of multi-company applications.

## Benefits of Immutability
- **Thread Safety**: Immutable configurations are inherently thread-safe, eliminating the need for complex synchronization.
- **Easier Testing**: Testing becomes straightforward as the configurations do not change unexpectedly during tests.
- **Reduced Risk of Errors**: With immutability, the risk of accidental changes to configurations is minimized, leading to more stable and reliable applications.

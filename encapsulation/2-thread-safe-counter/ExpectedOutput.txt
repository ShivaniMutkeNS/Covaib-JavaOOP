=== Thread-Safe Counter Demo ===

=== Basic Counter Operations ===
Initial count: 0
After increment: 1
After decrement: 0
After add(5): 5
After subtract(2): 3
Final count: 3

=== Thread Safety Test ===
Starting 10 threads, each incrementing 1000 times...
All threads completed!
Final count: 10000
Expected count: 10000
✅ Thread safety verified!

=== Concurrent Operations Test ===
Starting mixed operations with 5 threads...
Thread 1: Incrementing 500 times
Thread 2: Decrementing 300 times
Thread 3: Adding 200
Thread 4: Subtracting 100
Thread 5: Incrementing 400 times
All threads completed!
Final count: 1700
✅ Concurrent operations successful!

=== Performance Test ===
Performing 100,000 operations...
Operations completed in: 45ms
Operations per second: 2,222,222
✅ Excellent performance!

=== Counter State Management ===
Current count: 1700
Is zero: false
Is positive: true
Is negative: false
Reset counter...
Count after reset: 0
Is zero: true

=== Summary ===
✅ Thread-safe counter working perfectly!
✅ All operations are atomic and thread-safe
✅ Performance is excellent
✅ State management works correctly
